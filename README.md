# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises and projects completed during my Machine Learning course. The exercises focus on various key machine learning concepts and techniques, ranging from data preprocessing and supervised learning to unsupervised learning and model evaluation.
## Contents:
+ Supervised Learning: Classification and regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines. 
+ Unsupervised Learning: Clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
+ Data Processing: Feature engineering, handling missing data.
+ Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, metrics(Mean square error, R2 score, ...).
+ Each code exercise demonstrates the practical application of core machine learning principles using popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.
